# Physical skills

A physical skill is something the lamp can do in the room: it notices
something with its senses and answers with its body, its light and its
voice. A skill made for Claude Code or Codex acts in software; a lamp skill
acts in the physical world. This document is the design, settled with the
owner on 2026-10-16 between 06:45 and 07:40.

The owner's direction, in order:
- Build the most capable skill first; safety and security for skills from
  other people come later, before anything is published.
- Owners build skills for their own lamp first, by talking to it. Publishing
  to the world comes much later.
- Prove the framework with a first set of skills that work well. Many
  behaviours built into V2 should become skills: "greeting users when they
  are back at their desk as a physical skill rather than an ad hoc
  implementation".
- Use the existing standards (Agent Skills' `SKILL.md`, MCP for tools)
  rather than inventing a format.

Decided the same morning: developers may publish skills from launch, listed
only after our review, and skills are free at launch. Neither happens before
the first skills below work.

## What V1 did

V1 had 30 skills in `autonomous-os/skills/`, each a `SKILL.md` with an
optional `skill.json` naming the capabilities it needs (`presence`,
`motion`, `light`, `expression`, `audio`). Read on 2026-10-16:

| V1 | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md`, the same format as OpenClaw and Claude | Keep |
| `skill.json` capabilities: one skill runs on any body that has them | Keep |
| The model reached the hardware by writing `[HW:/led/off]` into its reply, or `curl` to the hardware server; regexes repaired the markdown the model mangled | Drop: skills call services and read topics |
| Every sensing event, schedule and skill update went into the one agent conversation as text (`[sensing:presence.enter] …`); prose in the lamp's character decided which skill answered | Drop: a skill's trigger is a subscription to a topic, decided in code |
| Thresholds and cooldowns written in prose for the model to compare (wellbeing's 45-minute hydration, a music cooldown left at its development value) | Drop: numbers live in the skill's data and the runtime applies them |
| The OS owns polling, thresholds and cooldowns; context is computed before the model sees it (the environment skill, `[wellbeing_context]`) | Keep: V1's cleanest contract |
| The ambient loop and the agent both wrote the LEDs; a lock was pushed through monitor events | Fix: requests carry who and how important, and the part that owns the light decides |
| `skill-creator`, with runs with and without the skill and a grader | Keep, taught the lamp's topics and services |
| `make push-skill`: live on the next conversation, no reboot | Keep |
| A store (catalogue, browse, one-tap install, publish by pull request) | Later |
| No physical skill had a test | Fix: every skill carries tests on the lamp's own recordings |

## What V2 has

Senses are **topics** on the bus ([bus.md](bus.md), [msgs.md](msgs.md));
actions are **services**, one JSON line in and one out on a socket.

Topics a skill can read today: `humans/faces/tracked` (faces, a passing id,
whether turned to the lamp), `voice/heard`, `voice/said`, `voice/state`,
`room/state`, `name/heard`, `controls/touch`, `controls/gesture`,
`ears/level`, `ears/sudden`, `air/state`, `schedule/due`, `tasks/status`,
`body/joint_states`, `body/hand`, `light/state`, `policy/decisions`,
`lamp/pause`, `mood/state`.

Services: the actions part (light and volume, and the schedule tools;
`/run/lampos-actions/call.sock`), Schedule, Tasks (work handed to Claude
Code or Codex), Memory, the eyes (`permit.sock` for the camera, `who.sock`
for faces it knows), the body (`mood.sock`: six gestures and a mood;
`gaze.sock`).

What is missing for skills:
- **No way to ask the voice to say something.** Each unprompted line (the
  hello, reminders, task news) is wired inside the voice by hand.
- **No arbitration.** The ring shows the newest light asked for, whoever
  asked; the body merges its inputs by fixed rules. bus.md's table says so
  ("Several requesters, one actuator: No").
- **`camera/image` is declared and published by nobody.**
- **The body plays only its six built-in gestures**; a skill cannot bring a
  move of its own.
- Expression's catalogue is data, but its triggers are a fixed list in code.

## The design

### A skill is a folder

```
welcome-back/
  SKILL.md        the standard: name, description, and how the lamp talks about it
  skill.toml      what it needs, its triggers, its steps, its tools
  moves/          body clips (data, played within the body's limits)
  lights/         ring patterns
  sounds/         short sounds
  tests/          recordings of the lamp's bus and what the skill should do in each
  run.py          optional: code for logic the data cannot say, given the bus
```

`skill.toml` for the first skill:

```toml
needs = ["eyes", "voice", "body", "light"]

[[trigger]]
topic = "humans/faces/tracked"
when = "appears"            # a face where there was none
absent_for = "5m"           # after at least five minutes with nobody
cooldown = "20m"

[ask]                       # anything the lamp starts itself asks the Policy first
policy = "hello"

[[do]]
body = { look_at = "face" }
light = "warm_glow"
say = "They are back at their desk. Greet them in one short line, by name if you know it."
```

The numbers are in the data, never in prose. The runtime applies them.

### `lamp-skills`, a new part

Its own process, its own owner, like every part
([build as components](architecture.md)):
- loads every skill folder and listens to the topics its triggers name;
- applies the conditions, timers and cooldowns;
- before anything unprompted, asks the Policy "may the lamp do this now?",
  so Jev is the one gate for everything the lamp starts itself;
- runs the steps by calling the services;
- publishes `skills/events`: triggered, asked, answered, done, with why.

### Four additions to V2

1. **A say service in the voice**: `say {skill, note or text, priority,
   expires}`. The voice speaks it as a written turn through the gates it
   already has (pause, a person speaking, a conversation under way). The
   hello, reminders and task news move onto it. Built behind `LAMP_SAY=on`
   ([speaking-first.md](speaking-first.md#asked-by-another-part-the-say-service-939)).
2. **Arbitration at the parts that own the body, the light and the
   speaker**: every request carries its source, a priority and a lease that
   lapses unless renewed (Expression's leases already work this way). The
   order: a person (their voice, their hand) over safety, over the
   conversation, over skills, over idle life.
3. **The eyes publish `camera/image`** (a file and when it was taken), so a
   skill can look.
4. **The body plays move files** from a skill, within its own speed and
   force limits.

### Tools for the model

A skill may declare tools: a service call or a function in `run.py`.
`lamp-skills` writes them beside the actions part's `tools.json`, which the
voice reads at every session open, so a new skill reaches Gemini without a
change to the voice. A skill's description is always in the lamp's
instructions; its body is loaded when it is used.

### Reflexes stay in the body and Expression

A tap on the head, a startle at a bang, giving way to a hand must answer in
under 150 ms. They stay built into the parts that own the body and the
light. A skill may add a clip for a reflex as data. Behaviours that unfold
over seconds are skills.

### Building one

"Lamp, learn to …": the lamp hands the request to Claude Code with the lamp
skill creator (V1's `skill-creator`, taught the topics, the services,
`skill.toml` and the tests). Claude Code writes the skill, tests it on the
lamp's own recordings (`lamp-bus record` and `replay`), installs it, and the
lamp shows the owner, who keeps it or asks for a change. Owners can also
build in Claude Code or Codex on their own computer; a change reloads live
on the lamp. A "My skills" page in the lamp's app (on or off, what each did
and when) comes once there are more than a handful. The store comes after
launch.

## The first skills

| Skill | Trigger | What it does | Replaces |
|---|---|---|---|
| Welcome back | A face arrives after 5 minutes with nobody | Policy; turns to them, the light warms, a short hello, by name if known | The hello (#883, `speak_up.rs`) |
| Reminders | `schedule/due` | Looks at the person, the ring pulses, says it | The reminder consumer in the voice |
| Task news | `tasks/status`: done or failed | Done: a small glad move and says so; failed: slumps, the ring goes red, says so | Task news in the voice (`task_news.rs`) |
| Stretch break | Someone at the desk for 50 minutes | Stretches itself as an invitation, never a lecture (creature.md) | New |
| Stuffy air | CO2 high for 10 minutes | Droops a little and dims a shade; mentions it only when spoken to (creature.md) | New |

The first three prove that built-in behaviour moves onto the framework; the
last two that a new skill needs no new code.

## Who builds what

| Piece | Builder |
|---|---|
| `lamp-skills`, the skill format and its tests; Welcome back | Seventh |
| The say service; the Policy as the gate; Reminders and Task news as skills | Second |
| Arbitration at the body and the light; move files | Third |
| The lamp skill creator, and Stretch break and Stuffy air written with it | Ten |
| Each piece on lamp-4ace as it lands | First |

Target: Welcome back running as a skill on lamp-4ace on 2026-10-17; all
five by 2026-10-19.

## Later

Permissions per sensor and actuator for skills from other people, signing,
review and the store: after the first skills work, before anything is
published.
