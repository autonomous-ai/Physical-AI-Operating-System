//! The lamp hears its name in the room's sound (`docs/name.md`). The model
//! does not: the text it works from leaves the name out, or makes another
//! word of it. After two people have talked about lunch, a called "what do
//! you think we should have for lunch?" reads to it as more of their talk,
//! and it stays out, with the lamp's own ears having heard "Hey Lamp".
//!
//! So when a request that was heard ends with nothing said, and the name
//! was heard plainly in the sound as that request began, the lamp tells
//! the model so, once, in a written note in place of speech (as it does
//! for a hello, `crate::speak_up`), and what the model then says is
//! spoken. The note gives the one sign the model lacked and leaves the
//! rest of the judgement where it was: other people's business said with
//! a name like the lamp's is still not the lamp's.
//!
//! It is late: a silent answer is only known to be one when the service's
//! wait for it has run out. Someone who speaks first is listened to and
//! the second look is dropped.
