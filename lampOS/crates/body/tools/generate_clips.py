"""The body's clips: the seven ported on 14 Oct, unchanged, and the V1 moves kept on 16 Oct
(lampOS/docs/skills.md, "V1's moves and emotions: what we take"), each cut to its readable window.

A cut clip takes the most active stretch of its recording of the asked length, begun at the stillest
frame near its start; it is scaled as a whole into the body's reach (FARTHEST, at most SCALE_CAP of the
recording), brought back to nothing over its last half second, and slowed under FASTEST, as the first
seven were. Writes Rust source to stdout and a table to stderr.
