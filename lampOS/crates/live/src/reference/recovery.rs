//! Bounded recovery of the capture-clocked reference.
//!
//! Without it, any doubt about which reference belongs to the capture in
//! hand is a fault and the session ends. That is right when the doubt cannot
//! be resolved and wasteful when it can. This module tells three cases
//! apart and treats each as what it is.
//!
//! **The capture loop was held up and nothing is missing.** The microphone
//! kept recording into its buffer and the speaker kept sending. Every packet
//! is there, in order, with the speaker's own timestamps a block apart. The
//! reference is paired with the capture by count, so it is exactly as known
//! as before; only its arrival is late. It is used, and counted as late.
//! Nothing is degraded. What bounds it is room: the ring, and how much the
//! microphone may have waiting.
//!
//! **The count can no longer be believed.** A packet is missing, the next
//! one starts somewhere else, the ring ran dry or over, or the speaker's own
//! timestamps show it accepted nothing for longer than its queue can cover,
//! so that what it played and what was counted have parted. The reference is
//! then **untrusted**: the canceller is not run, the capture goes on as the
//! microphone recorded it, no echo evidence is given, and a status says so
//! with the cause. No silence is put in the reference's place and no old
//! reference is passed off as current.
//!
//! **Fresh reference returns.** Once a run of packets that arrived fresh and
//! follow one another without a gap fills the ring to its working level, the
//! canceller is reset onto it: a **reseed**, with a new DSP epoch. The
//! frames the canceller never saw are counted as skipped under their own
//! cursors; no counter is rewound and nothing is renumbered. The canceller
//! starts cold, so its evidence is withheld until it has processed three
//! seconds of the lamp's own sound, as V1 waits three seconds into playback
//! before it listens: **warming**.
//!
//! Recovery is bounded twice: a reference may stay untrusted for a second,
//! and three reseeds are allowed in a minute. Past either the worker ends
//! with a fault that says which. Privacy, a malformed or regressing packet
//! and a capture clock that runs backwards are never recovered from.
//!
//! # The fixed margin
//!
//! The fixed-margin reference gets one thing from this module, and it is
//! the thing that ends its sessions on a lamp. Its margin is a count of
//! render blocks against capture blocks, and the two devices' clocks differ:
//! on one lamp by 157 ppm, which moves the count a block a minute and used
//! the margin up after 378.6 s of an idle conversation. Nothing was late and
//! nothing was lost. With recovery, a margin used up while both sides are
//! alive and on time is **re-centred**: the canceller is reset, given the
//! newest accepted blocks again as its lead, and the count the margin is
//! measured against is moved by exactly what the status says. It warms as
//! after any reseed and spends the same budget. A cold canceller is best
//! had when nobody needs it, so the re-centre is made two blocks before the
//! bound if the room has been still and the lamp silent for half a second,
//! and at the bound regardless. A capture loop that fell
//! behind, a speaker that stopped, a lost packet: in the fixed mode those
//! are still the faults they were. The capture-clocked reference never
//! needs a re-centre, because its count does not drift.
