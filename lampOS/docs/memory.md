# The lamp's memory

`lamp-memory` (`crates/memory`) keeps what the lamp remembers from one day to
the next: a journal of every exchange it took part in (what it was asked, as
the provider wrote it down, what it answered, and when) and the things it was
asked to keep ("remember that I take my coffee black"). It is decision 12 of
[brain-build.md](brain-build.md). Memory is one person's: until the lamp can
tell people apart everything is under the person id `everyone`, and no request
gives one person's memory in answer to another's.

## The process

Its own process, so that the lamp talks on, without recalling earlier days,
when this one has stopped, hung or crashed. Others ask over a Unix stream
socket and never read its files.

    lamp-memory --dir ABSOLUTE_DIR --socket ABSOLUTE_SOCKET_PATH [--keep-days N] [--utc-offset-minutes M]

`--dir` is made with mode 0700 if missing, `--socket` with mode 0600, and a
socket file nobody answers on is replaced. A relative path, an unknown option
or a `--dir` its group or everyone can enter exits with 2 and says why; an
answered socket or a `--dir` another `lamp-memory` has open exits with 1. Once
the store is open a file `ready`, holding `ready` and a newline, is kept
beside the socket.

One connection is served at a time. A client has two seconds to send a whole
request line and two to take its answer, or it is dropped; a silent open
connection makes the next client wait, so close when you have your answer.
Each request is logged in one line (op, person, outcome, counts), never with a
word of what was said or kept. The process cannot catch a signal (the standard
library has no way and the crate takes in nothing else): SIGTERM ends it where
it stands. A line is on the disk before its request is answered, so nothing
remembered is lost, but the socket and `ready` stay until the next start
clears them or systemd removes the runtime directory.

## On the disk

    <dir>/<person>/journal-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl   {"id":1,"at_unix_ms":1791892800000,"heard":"...","said":"..."}
    <dir>/<person>/kept.jsonl                 {"id":2,"at_unix_ms":1791892800000,"text":"..."}

Directories are 0700, files 0600. A person id is `[a-z0-9_-]{1,32}`; anything
else is refused before it is near a path. The day is the local day of
`at_unix_ms`, `--utc-offset-minutes` east of UTC (default 0; 420 for UTC+7).
Ids rise for each person across both files, and after a restart go on from the
highest on the disk. A line is added with one `write` and `sync_data`; a
removal writes the file anew beside the old one and renames it into place. A
line that does not read as an entry, such as one a power cut stopped in, is
skipped and counted (`skipped_lines`), and the rest of the file is used.

## Requests

One JSON object on a line, answered by one on a line: `"ok":true` and the
result, or `"ok":false`, an `"error"` (`bad_json`, `bad_request`, `unknown_op`,
`too_long`, `bad_person`, `bad_day`, `bad_time`, `empty`, `storage`) and a
`"message"`. A refusal never ends the connection. Each takes an optional
`"person"`, `everyone` if left out.

    {"op":"append","at_unix_ms":1791892800000,"heard":"How do I take my coffee?","said":"Black."}
    {"op":"remember","person":"mai","at_unix_ms":1791892800000,"text":"takes her coffee black"}
    {"op":"kept","max_bytes":2000}
    {"op":"recall","query":"coffee","day":null,"limit":8,"max_bytes":4096}
    {"op":"forget_last"}
    {"op":"forget_all","person":null}
    {"op":"status"}

- `append`, `remember`: `{"ok":true,"id":3}`. `heard` or `said` may be left out.
- `kept`: `entries` of `{id, at_unix_ms, text}`, the newest that fit in
  `max_bytes` of text, oldest first.
- `recall`: `entries` of `{"kind":"exchange", id, at_unix_ms, heard, said}` or
  `{"kind":"kept", id, at_unix_ms, text}`, oldest first. With `day`
  (`YYYY-MM-DD`): that local day's exchanges. With `query`: what in the kept
  list and the journal has any of its words as a whole word, whatever the
  case; more of the words rank first, then the newer. With both: that day's
  exchanges that match. With neither: the newest exchanges.
- `forget_last` removes the entry with the person's highest id, of either kind:
  `{"ok":true,"removed":{"kind":"kept","id":2,"at_unix_ms":1791892800000}}` or
  `"removed":null`. Which entry, never its text.
- `forget_all` empties one person's directory, unreadable lines included:
  `{"ok":true,"removed":14}`. With `"person":null`, everyone's; every other
  request but `status` refuses `null`.
- `status`: `people`, each `{person, exchanges, kept, bytes, oldest_day,
  newest_day, skipped_lines}`, everyone's unless one is named.

## Limits, and what happens at each

- A request line over 64 KiB: `too_long`; the next line is read as usual.
- `heard` 600 bytes, `said` 800, `text` 300: cut at a character, never refused.
  Whitespace and control characters become single spaces first; an entry with
  nothing left is refused (`empty`).
- 200 kept things for a person: the oldest is dropped as the next arrives.
- `--keep-days N` (default 30): a journal day is deleted once it is more than
  N days before today by the lamp's clock, at start and at the first request
  of a new local day. Kept things have no age. A clock set far ahead empties
  the journal.
- `recall`: `limit` 8 unless given, at most 50; `max_bytes` 4096 unless given,
  at most 16384; more is lowered, not refused. Bytes are of text; the first
  entry that does not fit whole ends the answer. A query's words are those of
  two characters or more, the first 16. `kept`: 4096 bytes unless given.
- `at_unix_ms` outside the years 1970 to 9999: `bad_time`.

## What it deliberately does not do

No audio, no pictures. Nothing is sent anywhere from here, though a line
leaves the lamp, to the voice provider, whenever the voice uses one in an
answer. No summaries and no model: text is matched word for word, without
stemming or Unicode normalisation. It does not know who speaks: the person is
whoever the caller says. Files are not encrypted; forgotten text is unlinked,
not scrubbed from the flash. The offset from UTC is fixed: no summer time.

## Not shown

Host tests on a development Mac: store and protocol in unit tests, the real
server on a socket in a thread, the built binary killed with SIGKILL and
started again. On 2026-10-13 the same 34 tests passed once as a Linux ARM64
build under emulation in a container. It has not run on a lamp, has no
systemd unit, and the voice does not call it yet. A power cut was imitated by cutting
a file short. Moving the socket to its path after binding it has run on macOS and in
that emulated Linux run. Times, on that Mac through the socket with thirty days of 200 exchanges
(`tests/timing.rs`): `append` 19 ms, `recall` by words 15 ms, by day or newest
under 1 ms, `forget_last` 50 ms. None is known for the lamp.
