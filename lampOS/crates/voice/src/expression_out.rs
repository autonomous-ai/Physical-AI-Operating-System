//! What the voice says about itself for the part that plans what the lamp
//! shows (`docs/expression.md`).
//!
//! Three things on the bus, each on the machine's own clock so that
//! another program can act on them to the hundredth of a second:
//!
//! - `voice/timing`: which turn is in hand and how far it has got
//!   (listening, thinking, speaking), whether the voice can keep what a
//!   person says, when the first sound of an answer is expected, and how
//!   each turn ended: cut off by someone, or over.
//! - `voice/activity`: whether the person being listened to is speaking at
//!   this moment, or has paused.
//! - `voice/playout`: each piece of the lamp's own sound, with when it
//!   reaches the loudspeaker and how loud it is.
//!
//! Nothing here decides anything. The rules for what is said are in
//! [`Timing`], which has no bus and takes its clock from the caller;
//! [`ExpressionOut`] puts what it says on the bus. Off unless the voice's
//! environment says `on`.
