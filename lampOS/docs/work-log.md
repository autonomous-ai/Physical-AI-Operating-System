# The second builder's log

The second builder's own record, on `lamp-second`, which only it writes
to. The tasks and their briefs are in `work-split.md` on `lamp-voice`.
Dates are the lamp's (Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh). The second builder works on an
Apple M2 Max laptop (macOS) and a Linux ARM64 virtual machine on that
laptop (Colima, 6 virtual cores, Debian bookworm, Rust 1.96.0). Neither is
the lamp, and nothing here was run on a lamp.

### Task 1: the end-of-turn model in a tenth of a second (2026-10-14)

**Built.** `lamp-turn-end --fast`: the same pinned model
(`smart-turn-v3.2-gpu.onnx`, unchanged), made 8-bit in memory as the worker
starts and run by ONNX Runtime 1.30.0 on two threads, the worker kept on
the cores with the largest `cpu_capacity` (cpu6 and cpu7 on the A733).
Without `--fast` the worker is what it was, byte for byte in its answers.
Also `lamp-turn-end bench` (the timing the task asked for),
`lamp-turn-end agree` (fast against exact on labelled clips),
`lamp-turn-end --check-model PATH --fast`, and
`WorkerCommand::smart_turn_fast` in `crates/turn-end-wire` for the voice
to start it with. Nothing in the voice uses it. Everything is in
`docs/endpoint-pilot.md`, "The fast model": what was tried and why each
was or was not taken, the measurements, the agreement tables, the cost of
the native library, and what was not shown.

**What it showed, on the Linux ARM64 VM** (M2 Max host; not the lamp):

| | Today (exact) | Fast |
|---|---|---|
| Verdict, features and model, median of 24 warm runs | 87.0 ms | 29.5–30.3 ms (three runs) |
| Worst of the 24 | 92.8 ms | 31.3–33.2 ms |
| Peak address space | 114 MiB | 243.5 MiB (cap 544 MiB) |
| Processor time per verdict | 88 ms | 59–61 ms, two threads |
| Processor time over 3 s idle | | 0 ms |

Held-out human clips (1,167, shards 4 and 5 of Pipecat's test set), asked
200 ms into a pause as the voice asks: 3 verdicts on the other side of 0.5,
18 in another of the voice's bands (5 newly "finished"), 95.54% correct
against 95.63%. The one multiplication kept in floats was chosen on the
development shards 0 and 1, not on these. By the exact model's measured
ratio (383 ms on lamp-4ace's fast cores against 87 ms here) the fast model
would take about 130 ms on the lamp. That is an estimate, not a
measurement.

**Two findings beside it:**

- tract 0.23.8 built in a Debian bookworm container has no fast 8-bit
  kernel: its build script's assembler probe (`.cpu
  generic+fp+simd+dotprod`) fails on binutils 2.40 and clang 14 to 16, so
  the SDOT kernel is left out without a warning. It does not touch any
  float model the lamp runs today, but anyone who tries 8-bit under tract
  will find it no faster. `.arch armv8.2-a+dotprod` assembles everywhere.
- Asked 100 ms into a pause instead of 200 ms, today's model is no worse
  at what ends a turn early: finished turns judged finished 91.5% against
  90.6%, unfinished ones judged finished 3.3% against 4.0% (held-out clips,
  digital replay). With the fast model that would put a verdict near
  230 ms. That is `ConfirmPolicy` in `crates/voice/src/activity.rs`, yours.

**Tested** on the Linux ARM64 VM, from `lampOS/`, on `1968ba608` rebased on
`lamp-voice` `40e9b1c00`: `cargo fmt --all --check` clean; `cargo clippy
--locked -p lamp-turn-end -p lamp-turn-end-wire --all-targets -- -D
warnings` clean; for `-p lamp-voice` and `-p lamp-voice-eval` clippy stops
on one warning in `lamp-body` (`run` in `crates/body/src/inspection.rs` is
never used), a crate this change does not touch, and lists no other
warning; `cargo test --locked` for `lamp-turn-end` (16 + 7 + 1 + 5, model
tests ignored), `lamp-turn-end-wire` (4 + 12), `lamp-voice-eval` (all
suites) and `lamp-voice` (744 in the library and every integration suite):
no failure; `cargo build --locked --workspace` builds. With the model and
the library present, all 4 tests of `tests/fast.rs` and all 11 of
`tests/parity.rs` pass on the VM, and the 4 of `tests/fast.rs` on macOS.

**On the lamp, as the service user, in the release directory:**

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.30.0/onnxruntime-linux-aarch64-1.30.0.tgz
tar -xzf onnxruntime-linux-aarch64-1.30.0.tgz
cp onnxruntime-linux-aarch64-1.30.0/lib/libonnxruntime.so.1.30.0 .
./lamp-turn-end bench smart-turn-v3.2-gpu.onnx 30                # as it is
./lamp-turn-end bench smart-turn-v3.2-gpu.onnx 30 --cores fast   # held to the fast cores
./lamp-turn-end bench smart-turn-v3.2-gpu.onnx 30 --fast         # the fast model
./lamp-turn-end --check-model smart-turn-v3.2-gpu.onnx --fast
```

It should show `"cores":[6,7]` on the fast runs, the second run's
`total_ms` median near 383 ms, the third's under 150 ms, and the check
exiting 0. To use it: in `crates/voice/src/coordinator/endpoint.rs`
(`EndpointRig::start`), `WorkerCommand::smart_turn_fast` in place of
`WorkerCommand::smart_turn`, for example behind an `--endpoint
smart-turn-fast` beside `smart-turn`.

**Where it is most likely to be wrong on the lamp:** the time. The
130 ms is a ratio carried over from the float model, and an 8-bit
multiplication may lose more on the A76 (half the M2's vector units) than
a float one does. If `bench --fast` is over 150 ms, try `--threads 1`
too: `lamp-name` uses the same two cores every 80 ms, and two threads can
wait on each other. Next most likely: the library not loading on the
lamp's system (it needs glibc 2.28 and `GLIBCXX_3.4.22`; the check says
so at once), and no `cpu_capacity` in the lamp's kernel (the worker then
falls back to the highest frequency; `"cores"` shows what it chose).

**Not shown:** anything on the lamp; speech through its microphone; the
fast model inside a full voice session; whether a 300 or 400 ms end suits
people.

### Task 2: try to break last night's changes to the voice (2026-10-14)

On its own branch only, as the task says: `second/voice-review`, one
commit `1d737f8e5` on `e93a828d1`. It adds tests and
`docs/voice-review-2026-10-14.md`; the one line outside a test file is
`mod review_2026_10_14;` at the end of the worker's test module in
`crates/voice/src/provider_worker.rs`. Nothing was fixed.

**Faults, each shown by a test that fails today, most serious first:**

1. **Speaks when it should not.** The note sent while someone is speaking
   ("your own ears caught your name, Lamp, just now") stays with a request
   that is then given up (judged a sound, or the microphone closed): no
   `activityEnd` is written, so the next request, by anyone and however
   much later, reaches the model with the note in front of it. Fails both
   with `kept-start` and without.
   `crates/gemini/tests/review_2026_10_14.rs`:
   `review_a_note_for_a_request_given_up_is_not_carried_into_the_next_request`.
2. **Speaks when it should not.** A name heard after a request's sound has
   ended, but before its first output, lets that request's held answer
   out (a busy room: "Hey man…" just after someone else's line).
   `crates/voice/src/provider_worker/tests/review_2026_10_14.rs`:
   `review_a_name_heard_after_a_requests_sound_ended_does_not_let_out_its_answer`.
3. **Speaks when it should not.** The second look's own written turn
   counts as one of a new session's two protected requests, so the next
   line of other people's talk is not held.
   `crates/voice/tests/review_2026_10_14.rs`:
   `review_the_lamps_own_second_look_does_not_use_up_a_new_sessions_held_requests`.
4. **Silent to a caller, narrow.** Before a request begins, the second
   look keeps only the newest hearing, so a later faint one (0.91)
   replaces a plain one (1.0).
   `review_a_plain_hearing_just_before_a_request_is_not_lost_to_a_fainter_one_after_it`
   (same file).
5. **No effect on behaviour.** `crates/name/src/said.rs` can publish a
   hearing scored above 1, which `NameHeard::check` refuses.
   `crates/name/tests/review_2026_10_14.rs`:
   `review_a_hearing_is_never_said_with_a_score_over_one`.

**Seen by reading, not shown by a test** (the second look is switched on
only from the environment, so no test can turn it on without a seam that
was not added): an answer that opens with a spoken "..." ends as
`nothing_said` and never reaches `second_look.finished`, so that call gets
no second look; the second look counts a hearing until the turn is over and
can bring a held answer back out; it can go to a renewed session that
never heard the call; `lamp-name` dates a hearing 0.8 s early after a gap;
the worker ignores a failure to subscribe to `name/heard` without a word.

**Found sound, with six passing tests:** `try_note` cannot end the link;
the second look is taken once and does not loop; the note goes out once
per request; a name counts only for its own request. No path was found
that answers twice or loses the link.

**Tested on** an Apple M2 Max laptop (macOS, Rust 1.96.0), from `lampOS/`:
`cargo fmt --all --check` clean; `cargo clippy -p lamp-voice -p
lamp-gemini -p lamp-name --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean; `cargo build
--workspace` builds; `cargo test -p lamp-gemini` and `-p lamp-name` fail
only on their review test; `cargo test -p lamp-voice`: library 726 passed
and 5 failed, `tests/review_2026_10_14` 3 passed and 2 failed. Of the
library's 5, one is the review test; the other 4 are older
`coordinator::motor` tests that time out after 2 s when the whole library
runs at once on this laptop (21 of them in another full run, and the same
21 on `origin/lamp-voice` without the review line); one at a time, all 46
in those groups pass. Nothing was run on the lamp.

**For the first builder:** the five failing tests are the work list, in
that order; each passes once its fault is mended. Most likely to matter on
the lamp: the first, because a "Hey Lamp" said alone and judged a sound is
an everyday event there.
